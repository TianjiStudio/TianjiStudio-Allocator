    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The IDEAM radar network consists of 4 dual-polarization C-band radars used to monitor precipitation behavior in the atmosphere at intervals of 5 to 10 minutes, depending on weather conditions. These radars are primarily used in the operation of national airports, weather forecasting, and research focused on analyzing the data collected to date by each of these systems.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "https://registry.opendata.aws/ideam-radares/\nHistorical and one-day delay data from the IDEAM radar network.\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://s3-radaresideam/               131.8 TiB",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The workflow is structured in three sequential steps:Metadata Retrieval: \n\n1. Download all metadata using AWS CLI over a dedicated network.  \n2. CAR Packaging: Bundle the metadata files into CAR format using the go-car tool.  \n3. Distribution: Deliver the resulting CAR files to the Service Provider (SP) via hard drives or network transfer.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Resources on AWS\nDescription\nLevel II data\nResource type\nS3 Bucket\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::s3-radaresideam\nAWS Region\nus-east-1\nAWS CLI Access (No AWS account required)\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://s3-radaresideam/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03645883 Seoul\nf03644142 Hong Kong\nf03645007 Hong Kong\nf03646493 Tokyo\nf03663680 Hong Kong\nf03663684 Hong Kong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
